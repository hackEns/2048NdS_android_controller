This is an Android 4.1 application created for my Samsung Galaxy S3

It sends sensor data over udp to my raspberry pi which controls PWM GPIO ports.
The raspberry pi client application is found in one the other repo's at https://github.com/rikvermeer

Functions:
- Reads sensors
- Sends the sensor data over udp

Future functions:
- Send the data over a multicast or broadcast UDP channel
- Add a TCP negotiation channel for selecting sensors, ranges, etc...
-- Create a generic interface that can be implemented by other applications

Todo:
- Make multiple classes for a neater structure
- Make threads for sending data
- Make the GUI
